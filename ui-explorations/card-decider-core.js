  There are two decider pages — Movies and TV — because James found one page

  splitting it immediately proved the point: **Continuing does not exist on the

  Two pages, one file. The pages differ in the prose they carry and the medium

  How a card says "Deluno is not watching this one".

  The road here is worth keeping, because three of the four attempts were mine and
  each was wrong for a different reason.

  1. DESIGN-001 gives an unmonitored title a half-grey **dot**. This render halved
     the **bar's fill** instead. James: *"I think the half was in reference to the
     dots which we have removed"* — right, and the measurement agreed before the
     argument did: on a Missing title, whose fill is 0% wide, the half rendered as
     nothing at all. A half works on a dot because a dot has no length of its own;
     a bar IS a length, and that length already means the fraction you hold.

  2. Overriding the bars with a flat neutral. Worked, and I talked myself out of it
     on the grounds that it "spends the bar's colour on a fact that is not about the
     title's state" — which is backwards: an unmonitored title's rung is not telling
     you to do anything, so its colour is the thing least worth keeping.

  3. A shield badge in the corner of the artwork. Reads well, but it is another
     thing on the picture, and Deluno already says monitoring in words on a line
     under the poster behind its own switch.

  4. What James settled on: *"the poster option should stay as a grey or black bar
     on the poster and the shield removed from the poster and kept under in the
     selectable options"*. **The bars go flat grey, the artwork stays clean, and
     the shield keeps its existing home under the poster.** Two facts, two places,
     neither borrowing the other's space — which is the same rule the top and
     bottom bars already follow.

  Black or grey is a switch. The thing to watch is that the TRACK is already grey,
  so a grey fill on a grey track could make the bar vanish and take the fraction
  with it — measured, both stay clear of it (black ΔE 19.2 dark / 74.9 light; grey
  21.3 / 35.5), so this is a taste call rather than a legibility one.
*/
/*
  **Unmonitored is an override, and it is always grey.**

  James, settling it: *"unmonitored titles are the override, they are always grey —
  once they are monitored they inherit the normal statuses"*.

  So there is one rule and no switch. If Deluno is not watching a title, both its
  bars are grey, whatever rung the title happens to sit on — because that rung is
  not telling you to do anything. The moment it is monitored again it inherits the
  ladder exactly as any other title does; nothing is remembered and nothing is
  special-cased.

  This is the only override in the design. Everywhere else, colour is decided by the
  title's state; here the state is overruled outright.

  The grey is a mid grey, not the track's. The track is `--mark-idle` — 26%
  lightness in dark, 82% in light — and a fill the same value as its track would
  make the bar vanish and take the fraction with it. Measured: ΔE 21.3 against the
  dark track, 35.5 against the light one, and white sits on it at 4.82.
*/
/*
  **One grey, flat, both bars.**

  James: *"why is the martian different grey to mad max and big buck bunny come
  on."* Because the override was applied to the fill and the track as two separate
  greys: The Martian is a Missing film, so its fill is 0% wide and what you see is
  the TRACK; Mad Max and Big Buck Bunny have 100% fills, so what you see is the
  FILL. Two greys, and which one you got depended on the title's rung — the very
  thing an override is supposed to stop mattering.

  So the fill and the track are the SAME value. An unmonitored title is one flat
  grey bar, identical on every card, whatever its rung and whatever its fraction.
  The count or the quality is still written on it, so the number survives; only the
  colour goes, which is the point.

  fill:  "hsl(220 8% 46%)",

/*
  There is no monitoring line, and `showMonitored` should stop being an option.

  It was kept underneath at first — I read *"kept under in the selectable options"*
  as *keep the line under the poster*. James: *"why is monitored under the poster,
  it doesnt need to be there anymore"*. He is right, and the reason is the one this
  codebase has already acted on once: **when a bar starts saying a fact, the switch
  that used to say it is removed.** `4bdfe45` deleted the Quality poster option the
  moment the bar carried the quality; `showEpisodeProgress` went the same way. A
  line reading "Not monitored" beneath a card whose bars have already gone neutral
  is the same fact twice.

  So monitoring is said by the bars alone, it is not switchable, and
  `CatalogueControls.cs` loses `showMonitored` exactly as it lost the other two.

  What a subtitle bar says when there is nothing to count, and in whose colour.

  **It inherits Upcoming, and nothing else.**

  The first version said *not here is Missing* for every title, which threw away the
  distinction the ladder exists to make — James: *"upcoming is the wrong colour, its
  missing yes but its upcoming too"*. So it inherited the title's reason for holding
  no files, whatever that reason was. That over-corrected, and he caught that too:
  *"subs should not be downloading it should always be missing"*.

  He is right, and the reason is sharper than the one he offered. **Upcoming and
  Downloading are different in kind.** Upcoming means the thing *cannot exist yet* —
  not released, not aired — so nothing can be fetched and calling it Missing is a
  category error. Downloading means it exists and is arriving, so its subtitles
  exist out there and you do not have them, which is precisely what Missing means.

  His own argument stands as the second reason: a film's download is worth a
  progress bar because it lasts, while a subtitle is a few kilobytes of text and
  would be here and gone before the bar could be read. A state nobody can ever see
  should not be modelled — the same rule that keeps a filter chip which can never
  match off the shelf.

  Unmonitored still overrides everything, as it does everywhere.

   Every scenario, once.

   This was an arbitrary handful of titles and it showed Missing three times,
   Upgradable twice and Quality met twice while covering the unmonitored half not
   at all — James: *"there are some duplicates as well... be sure to cover ALL
   scenarios, toggles on and off etc etc"*.

   So it is a catalogue now, not a sample: **one card per distinct scenario, no
   repeats**, and it is drawn whether or not the page is signed in — a real
   library cannot be relied on to contain a downloading title or an unmonitored
   one at the moment you happen to look, and those are exactly the cards a design
   fails on. The real library is drawn underneath it, as itself.
   ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */
/*
  **Every combination, monitored and unmonitored — enumerated, not hand-picked.**

  James: "there should be every possible combination monitored and every possible
  combination unmonitored", after catching that a hand-listed catalogue had grown a
  duplicate: two cards drawing the identical shape (Quality met / monitored / 100% /
  100%), differing only in string length. My audit had asserted that scenario NAMES
  were unique, which is a different question, and is why it passed.

  So the catalogue is the cross-product of the state space:

      rung  x  subtitle state  x  monitored

  A title holding no files has no independent subtitle state — it inherits the
  title's own reason for having none — so those rungs contribute one row rather
  than four. Artwork repeats where there are more states than posters, because the
  picture is not the subject; the STATE never repeats, and the audit proves it by
  comparing rendered shapes rather than labels.
