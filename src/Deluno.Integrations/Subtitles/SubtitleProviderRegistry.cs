/// Every subtitle source Deluno ships.

/// <para><b>Seven, not eight.</b> MediaMop's registry listed
/// <c>opensubtitles_org</c> and <c>opensubtitles_com</c> as separate providers,
/// with separate credential fields and separate rows on its settings screen —
/// and both keys mapped to the same handler, which posts to the <c>.com</c> API
/// and records the grab as <c>.com</c> either way. It was one provider counted
/// twice, and somebody filling in two sets of credentials for it would have got
/// the same source twice or neither. That is exactly the shape this port exists
/// to leave behind.</para>
///
/// <para>Order is the order they are tried when nothing else separates them:
/// the two that need no account first, so a new install finds something before
/// it is asked to sign up for anything. A person's own priority on the stored
/// row overrides it.</para>
