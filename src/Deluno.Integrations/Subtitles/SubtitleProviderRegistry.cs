/// <summary>
/// Every subtitle source Deluno ships.
///
/// <para><b>Six, from MediaMop's eight.</b> Two went, and each for a reason that
/// was measured rather than reasoned about.</para>
///
/// <para><b>YifySubtitles is gone</b>, and it is worth writing down what was
/// actually checked, because the obvious conclusion was wrong twice.</para>
///
/// <para>MediaMop talked to an undocumented <c>/api?q=</c> endpoint on
/// <c>yifysubtitles.ch</c>. That host, <c>.org</c> and <c>yts-subs.com</c> now
/// answer that path with HTML. James pointed out that <c>yifysubtitles.tv</c> is
/// alive, and it is: it has a real JSON endpoint at <c>/api/search/</c> that
/// returns films. But films are not subtitles, and the listing behind them
/// (<c>/load/movie/{id}</c>) answers with an interstitial page — marked
/// <c>noindex, nofollow</c>, titled "Finding Your Fix", containing a fake
/// progress bar and a scripted redirect to an unrelated third-party
/// domain.</para>
///
/// <para>So there is no subtitle to fetch there, only an advertising redirect
/// chain to follow. Deluno does not follow those, and a provider that could only
/// ever find nothing is worse than one that is absent: its health reads fine and
/// it makes every film search one request slower.</para>
///
/// <para><b>And OpenSubtitles was one source counted twice.</b> MediaMop's registry listed
/// <c>opensubtitles_org</c> and <c>opensubtitles_com</c> as separate providers,
/// with separate credential fields and separate rows on its settings screen —
/// and both keys mapped to the same handler, which posts to the <c>.com</c> API
/// and records the grab as <c>.com</c> either way. It was one provider counted
/// twice, and somebody filling in two sets of credentials for it would have got
/// the same source twice or neither. That is exactly the shape this port exists
/// to leave behind.</para>
///
/// <para>Order is the order they are tried when nothing else separates them:
/// the two that need no account first, so a new install finds something before
/// it is asked to sign up for anything. A person's own priority on the stored
/// row overrides it.</para>
