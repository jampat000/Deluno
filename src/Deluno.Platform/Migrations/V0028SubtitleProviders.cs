/// <para><b>Why it is a table of its own rather than rows in
/// <c>indexer_sources</c>.</b> An indexer has a base URL, a protocol, categories
/// and a sharing policy; a subtitle provider has none of those and has a
/// provider key instead — Deluno ships the client, so there is no address to
/// configure. Sharing one table would mean eight columns that are always null on
/// one kind and four that are always null on the other, which is the shape that
/// makes a reader guess. <c>download_clients</c> is its own table for exactly the
/// same reason.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Credentials are protected, not stored.</b> <c>username</c> is plain
/// because it is not a secret and a person needs to see which account is
/// configured; <c>secret</c> and <c>api_key</c> go through
/// <c>ISecretProtector</c>, the same as an indexer's API key and a download
/// client's password.</para>
