# Deluno Metadata Broker Contract

Deluno supports three metadata modes:

- `direct`: Deluno calls provider APIs from the local install using locally configured keys.
- `broker`: Deluno calls a metadata broker service so users do not need provider keys.
- `hybrid`: Deluno calls the broker first, then falls back to local direct provider keys.

The application provider expects broker services to expose the following contract.

## Search

`GET /metadata/search`

Query parameters:

- `mediaType`: `movies` or `tv`.
- `query`: title text.
- `year`: optional release/start year.
- `providerId`: optional provider-specific ID for exact refreshes.

Response:

  ]
}
```

## Local Development Endpoint

The app exposes a local authenticated broker-compatible endpoint at:

- `GET /api/metadata/broker/status`
- `GET /api/metadata/broker/search`

This endpoint deliberately bypasses broker/hybrid orchestration and uses direct TMDb lookup, so it can be used to verify the contract without causing recursive provider calls.

## Hosted Broker Notes

A hosted broker can implement the same `/metadata/search` response shape and add:

- provider-key isolation
- attribution enforcement
- request caching
- rate-limit protection
- provider failover
- telemetry for source quality and latency

Commercial/licensing terms must be reviewed before any hosted broker is offered beyond internal development.
