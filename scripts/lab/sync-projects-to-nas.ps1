.SYNOPSIS
    Mirrors C:\Projects to a NAS share, and reports what git has not got.

.DESCRIPTION
    Two different jobs are often confused for one another, so this does both
    and keeps them apart.

    GitHub holds the source. It does not hold the 250 MB of vendor installers
    and fixture media that provisioning needs, it does not hold anything
    uncommitted, and it does not hold the four directories under C:\Projects
    that are not repositories at all. A repository being "pushed" is not the
    same as the machine being backed up.

    So: robocopy mirrors the whole tree to the share, and separately every git
    repository is checked for work that only exists on this disk. The second
    half matters more than the first - a backup of an uncommitted change is
    better than nothing, but knowing it is uncommitted is better still.

    Mirror mode deletes files on the NAS that are gone from C:\Projects. That is
    what "mirror" means and it is the right default for a working copy, but it
    means the share is a mirror rather than an archive: it will not save you
    from deleting something and not noticing for a week. Use -Archive for a
    dated copy that never deletes.

.PARAMETER Destination
    The share, e.g. \\storage-city\Backups\Projects.

.PARAMETER Archive
    Copy into a dated subdirectory and never delete. Slower and bigger; use it
    before anything drastic.

.PARAMETER ReportOnly
    Say what would move, and what git has not got, without copying.

.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/lab/sync-projects-to-nas.ps1 -Destination \\storage-city\Backups\Projects -ReportOnly
    ./scripts/lab/sync-projects-to-nas.ps1 -Destination \\storage-city\Backups\Projects
