.SYNOPSIS
    Build the browser app and put it on the rig, replacing what is there.

.DESCRIPTION
    A front-end-only change does not need a republish of the host — it needs
    `apps/web/dist` on top of `C:\Deluno\App\wwwroot`. That was done by hand,
    as `Copy-Item -Force` over the top, every time.

    Which is why the rig had 7,523 files and 104 MB in `wwwroot\assets` for a
    build that emits 80: every chunk from every deploy since the box was set
    up, plus `.br`/`.gz` siblings from a compression step that no longer runs.
    Vite hashes its filenames, so nothing was ever overwritten and nothing was
    ever removed. It served the right build the whole time and would have gone
    on growing forever.

    Two things stop it coming back. The assets directory is emptied before the
    copy rather than written over, so what is on the rig is what the build
    emitted and nothing else. And the copy is checked afterwards by reading
    every asset `index.html` asks for back off the rig — a deploy that half
    happened is the one failure this script exists to catch, and a file count
    would not catch it.

    The host is not stopped and does not need to be: `UseStaticFiles` reads
    from disk per request and holds no lock on wwwroot. Stopping it is for a
    C# change, which this is not.
