 * different plane, it is the same white with a hairline drawn on it; and a
 * screen of that at full size glares. James: <i>"light mode needs to be toned
 * down a bit and not so bright smack in your face"</i>.</p>
 *
 * <p>What is guarded here is the second half of that fix, because it is the
 * half that is invisible and therefore the half that rots. Contrast is a
 * ratio: darkening the ground silently darkens every signal's standing against
 * it, and Missing would have slipped from 4.87:1 to 4.48:1 — under AA — with
 * nobody editing a single red. So each signal was darkened to match, and these
 * are the ratios it has to keep. Raise the surfaces back towards white, or
 * lighten one mark by eye, and this fails rather than somebody's screen.</p>
